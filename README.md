TOOLS USED: MS Excel, Power BI

SUMMARY: After analyzing the data, we found that while the overall restaurant network is profitable, some individual restaurants are operating at a loss. Our analysis explored various factors affecting profitability, such as discounts and offers, commission fees, and other cost-related aspects. By identifying these challenges, we were able to suggest strategic adjustments that could help struggling restaurants improve their financial performance.

CONCLUSION: Found that reducing discounts by 10% could lead to a 5% increase in profit, while even a small adjustment in commission fees could further boost earnings. These insights highlighted practical ways to enhance profitability without compromising customer satisfaction
